### Technologies

### What I Learnt

*  I learnt how to use JSX, which is a syntax extension to JavaScript. It allows us to build UI elements right in the JavaScript code!
*  How to create components, pass them data using props and manage their data using state.
*  How to render components on the page and include some initial data.
*  How to add a function to our ContactManager component to add a new person to our contacts state array.
* That props can be used to pass down not only state, but also functions, that may manipulate the state.
